# ExoPlayer
 The Android framework provides MediaPlayer as a quick solution for playing media with minimal code, and the MediaCodec and MediaExtractor classes are provided for building custom media players. ExoPlayer is an open source project that provides a solution falling somewhere between these two options. It is a player that you can modify and extend.

# The Main Components Of ExoPlayer
## PlaybackControlView 
is a view for controlling ExoPlayer instances. It displays standard playback controls including a play/pause button, fast-forward and rewind buttons, and a seek bar.
## SimpleExoPlayerView 
is a high level view for SimpleExoPlayer media playbacks. It displays video, subtitles and album art during playback, and displays playback controls using a PlaybackControlView.
